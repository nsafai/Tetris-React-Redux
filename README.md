# Tetris (in React and Redux) - Web and Native OSX / Windows app via Electron

This is a fully functional version of the original Tetris (1984) built in React and Redux, and can be run in any modern web browser. The goal is to eventually ship this app via Electron so it can be played on any device.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn electron-dev`
Build and run OSX app locally

### `yarn electron-pack`
Build Windows / OSX / Android and iPhone apps

### `yarn start` 

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
